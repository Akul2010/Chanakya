# Chanakya
Chanakya is a simple yet elaborate chatbot that is currently being built from scratch in C++. Based on the Artificial Intelligence concept of 'Expert Systems', the objective of the chatbot is for it to be one that is well-versed only in a *single domain* (i.e, for example, in **Indian History** or **Star Wars** or **IPL Cricket Statistics**). This would make this chatbot ideal for situations which require specialised assistance or domain-related knowledge.

Chanakya is a chatbot whose specialised knowledge in any field is derived from information stored in a knowledge base. The information in this knowledge base can be completely built from scratch by **you**! This can be done using a simple, unique syntax that I created just for this purpose.

It's named after Chanakya, an ancient Indian teacher and royal advisor, who is credited with playing an important role in the establishment of the Mauryan Empire. He was a pretty wise guy who knew the **answers** to a lot of questions.

## Work In Progress
Chanakya is currently still a work in progress. Keep checking out this space for further updates on this project.
