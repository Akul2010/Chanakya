# Chanakya
Based on the Artificial Inteligence concept of Expert Systems, Chanakya is a completely ***scalable*** and ***customisable*** yet simple chatbot built wholly from scratch in C++.

  * The objective is that, any single point in time, the chatbot can be an expert only in a **single** domain.
  * This domain could be anything (*Star Wars*, *Indian History*, etc) and can be completely customised by **you**!
  * This makes Chanakya ideal for situations which require a *specialised* artificial assistant.

Chanakya's knowledge is retrieved from information stored in a **knowledge base**.
  
  * This knowledge base can be built by **you**, the user, and as mentioned earlier, can store information related to any domain.
  * The syntax for building the knowledge base is new, simple and was developed for this purpose. More below on usage and deployment.

#### Etymology

It's named after **Chanakya** (371 BC - 283 BC), an ancient Indian teacher and royal advisor. Known with being a person who could *answer* the most ardous of questions, he is credited with playing an important role in the establishment of the Mauryan Empire. 

## Work In Progress
Chanakya is currently still a work in progress. Keep checking out this space for further updates on this project.
