# Chanakya
Chanakya is a simple yet elaborate chatbot that is currently being built from scratch in C++. Based on the Artificial Intelligence concept of 'Expert Systems', the objective of the chatbot is for it to be one that is well-versed only in a *single domain* (i.e, for example, in **Indian History** or **Star Wars** or **IPL Cricket Statistics**). This would make this chatbot ideal for situations which require specialised assistance or domain-related knowledge.

Chanakya is a chatbot whose specialised knowledge in any field is derived from information stored in a knowledge base. The information in this knowledge base can be completely built from scratch by **you**! This can be done using a simple, unique syntax that I created just for this purpose.

## Work In Progress
Chanakya is currently still a work in progress. Keep checking out this space for further updates on this project.
